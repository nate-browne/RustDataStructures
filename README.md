# Data Structures
## Implementing Basic Data Structures for Learning Purposes

In an effort to assist in learning Rust, this repo holds re-implementations of the
data structures I implemented over in my [CSE 12 redesign](https://github.com/nate-browne/CSE12_Redesign) but in Rust.

There's not much flash here, but each sub-repository will be a fully fledged Rust
project built with Cargo for ease of use.
